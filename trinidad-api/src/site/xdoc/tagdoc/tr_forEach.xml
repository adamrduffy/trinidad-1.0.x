   <b>Tag name:</b> &lt;tr:forEach&gt;
   <br/>
<p>
        The forEach tag is a replacement for the JSTL
&lt;c:forEach&gt; tag that works with ADF Faces components.  In JSF
1.1, &lt;c:forEach&gt; cannot be used with any JSF components or tags.
(<b>Note</b>: this tag is not supported in Facelets, because c:forEach
is functional in Facelets.  It will also be removed in JSF 1.2/JSP
2.1, because c:forEach will become functional there too.)  This tag
brings that functionality to JSF, but it is limited to ADF Faces tags.
This tag also has several limitations not found in &lt;c:forEach&gt;:

<ul>

<li>&lt;tr:forEach&gt; does not currently support scenarios where the
size of the "items" list or array changes from one request to the
next. It may be possible to work around this in specific scenarios by
manually deleting all children of the parent component
(&lt;tr:selectOneListbox&gt; in the above example), but this has not
yet been tested.</li>

<li>&lt;tr:forEach&gt; does not support arbitrary
java.util.Collections; it can only iterate over java.util.Lists or
arrays.</li>

<li>&lt;tr:forEach&gt; executes at the time the JSP tag executes. So
it does not have access to any EL variables that are created by JSF
components.  For example, the &lt;tr:table&gt; creates an EL variable
using the value of the "var" attribute. However, this EL variable is
not available to &lt;tr:forEach&gt;</li>

</ul></p><h4>Example:</h4><source>
            &lt;tr:selectOneListbox value="#{someValue}"&gt;
              &lt;tr:forEach var="item" items="#{model.listOfItems}"&gt;
                &lt;tr:selectItem value="#{item.value}" text="#{item.text}"/&gt;
              &lt;/tr:forEach&gt;
            &lt;/tr:selectOneListbox&gt;</source><source>
            &lt;tr:forEach varStatus="vs" begin="1" end="5"&gt;
              &lt;tr:outputText id="ot2" value="#{vs.index} #{vs.count} #{vs.begin} #{vs.current}"/&gt;
            &lt;/tr:forEach&gt;</source>
